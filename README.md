# I-ve-tried-to-create-a-port-of-mod-OpenComputers-for-Forge-1.20.1-NeoForge-1.21.1
An experimental Minecraft mod development using multiple AI assistants simultaneously: ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Phind. This project explores AI strengths and challenges in coding OpenComputers for Forge 1.20.1, showing that structured workflows and human oversight are crucial for successful collaboration with AI

# üñ•Ô∏è OpenComputers for Forge 1.20.1 ‚Äî The AI-Powered Development Journey

**Experimental Project**
This mod was born out of an unconventional experiment ‚Äî building a Minecraft mod using multiple AI systems as coding partners simultaneously.

## üß† Behind the Scenes: Developing with AI
### The Ambitious Experiment

I set out to try something new:

* Collaborating with ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Phind, and other AI assistants all at once
* Copy-pasting code snippets between different AI interfaces in real-time
* Using Replit as a shared coding and testing environment

### The Reality Check

Despite the excitement, I ran into several issues:

* Different AIs often gave conflicting suggestions
* Context was lost when switching between AI platforms
* Debugging became complicated due to scattered code and errors

### What Actually Worked

Surprisingly, some patterns emerged that made the process productive:

1. **Specialized AI Roles**:

   * ChatGPT for architectural design and initial drafts
   * DeepSeek for Lua implementation and performance tuning
   * Phind for Forge-specific adaptations and optimizations
     
2. **Version Control to the Rescue**:

   * Git was essential to manage conflicting AI suggestions
   * Separate branches for each AI‚Äôs contribution helped with comparing and merging
## üõ†Ô∏è Current Status: About 40% or less Functional
### Key Working Features

* Core computer systems (CPU, Memory, GPU)
* Lua sandbox with basic APIs
* Modular component architecture

Known Issues:

* Occasional memory leaks generated by AI-written code
* Thread safety needs thorough human review
* Some edge cases in component interactions remain untested

* üí° Lessons Learned

1. **AI as Assistants, Not Replacements**

   * They‚Äôre great for boilerplate and straightforward code
   * Complex system integration still needs a human touch

2. **Consistency Matters**

   * Sticking to one AI per subsystem was more effective
   * Regular manual testing prevented major setbacks

3. **The Human Factor is Crucial**

   * Final debugging and architectural decisions require real understanding
   * AI can assist, but humans must own the process
‚ÄúThe project works despite the chaotic process, not because of it. AI collaboration shows promise, but only within structured workflows.‚Äù
